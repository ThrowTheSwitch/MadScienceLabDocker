## MadScienceLab Docker Images Builds

Each build produces multiple variants of the `madsciencelab` Docker images containing Ceedling and its supporting frameworks as well as various utilities and compilation toolchains. Each image targets multiple host platforms.

A dev build of this repository in a Github Action generates files and validates the Docker image build. A release build also pushes the resulting Docker images to Docker hub.

See the [Docker Hub repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/throwtheswitch) for official releases of the resulting Docker images and their documentation.

## Contents

* A zip archive for each Docker image containing the generated Dockerfile and any other generated file artifacts used to build the image in Docker Hub.
* A zip archive of the entire project including the static assets used to build the Docker images.

See this reositoryâ€™s documentation for instructions on how to use the tools of this repository and how to build these Docker images.
