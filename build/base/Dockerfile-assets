## Copy Ruby assets for inclusion in image
##
## Notes:
## - Gems must be downloaded manually to the vendored bse/assets/gems directory.
## - To find the list of gems and versions needed, visit
##     https://rubygems.org/gems/ceedling/versions/<version>/dependencies
## - The easiest way to vendor a gem is `gem fetch <name> -v <version>` with volume mapped to assets/gems.
